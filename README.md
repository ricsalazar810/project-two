Project 2 ETL

For Project 2, my partner and I built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. We created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. We then uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
